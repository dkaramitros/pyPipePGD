# pyPipePGD
Analysis of buried pipelines subjected to Permanent Ground Displacements (PGDs).  

## Information
This is a collection of analytical methodologies for the integrity analysis of buried pipelines subjected to Permanent Ground Displacements (PGDs), with emphasis on active seismic fault crossings.  
The available methodologies currently include:
- Continuous pipelines crossing active strike-slip faults.
- Continuous pipelines crossing active normal faults *(in development)*.
- Jointed pipelines crossing active strike-slip faults *(in development)*.
- Jointed pipelines crossing active normal faults *(in development)*.

## Instructions
The analytical methodologies are implemented in Python ```.py``` files, as functions.  
A series of documented Jupyter ```.ipynb``` notebooks are provided to demonstrate their application.
